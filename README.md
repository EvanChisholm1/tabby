# TABBY

just press tab and get a completed token.

I like the autocomplete feature that happens in google docs, I just wished that I could decide when to use it and have a little bit more fine grained control over hyperparams. this website is a simple text box that has autocomplete powered by language models. currently uses stablelm 1.6b but there is no reason you can't swap it out for mistral 7b, llama, phi or your favorite llm.
